# MET-detection
### TAU final project in MET detection using transformer network


## About The Project
This project includes an analysis of a database of patients with brain metastases from the Bratz 2023 database. In this project we will perform image processing and segmentation of brain metastases/glioma tumors from MRI brain scans of patients.

In the heart of this project lies A deep learning model of segmentation using a transformer network for each patient at each point in time when scanned with T1, T2, FLAIR and T1-contrast enhanced scans. 
We would like to understand which method gives us the best performance.

We would like to have following information: identification of the number of metastases, the volume of the metastases and their location.
In addition, we would like to receive the detailed information for each patient in a format that will allow us to enter the information in a computerized database.
Also, a user-friendly UI tool will be developed in order to allow us to analyze segmentation from MRI scans for additional patients who are not in the current database.
